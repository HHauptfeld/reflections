2/14/21 Reflection

In this reflection, I'll be reviewing [this data visualization](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lj4wqt/the_railroads_of_the_world_oc/) that depicts the 
railroads of the world. I thought this visualization was really interesting to look at because the railroads seem to almost outline certain area of the world so much so that 
the viewer could interpret the visualization as a piece of minimalist artwork that depicts a world map. Another interesting part about this visualization is that there is no
legend or even any text at all that explains what the viewer is looking at. For example, clicking [here](https://i.redd.it/kcewwuje5ah61.png) will show you just a picture of 
the visualization with no context of where it came from or what it represents. There is no text in the visualization to explain what the viewer is looking at. The obvious
negative aspect of this is that the viewer can't really understand what they're looking at without being given some sort of explanation that is outside of the visualization.
Hoever, a positive aspect is that this visualization is simplistic. It's easy and interseting to look at in general, and it's also even more interesting to look at once you
understand what it means. Another thought I had about this visualization is that I find it's really easy to find where railroads are most extensively used in the world. The use
of bold, direct colors for the lines that represent railroads makes it really easy to spot where there's alot of railroads, such as the USA and western Europe. On the opposite
side, it's easy to determine where there are very few railroads due to the white space on the screen that really seems to also stand out, such as the upper part of the entire
continent of Africa. Overall, I think this visualization has its pros and its cons, but it is still interesting to look at.
