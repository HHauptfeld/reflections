2/14/21 Reflection

In this reflection, I'll be reviewing [this data visualization](https://www.reddit.com/r/mathpics/comments/l62b19/probability_distribution_in_monopoly_using_markov/) that 
depicts the probability of landing on each position on the board of Monopoly. Something I like about his visualization is how it is set up in the same way that a Monopoly board
is set up. However, something I don't like about this visualization is that the actual numbers of the probabilities are small, and hard to read. For example, all of the 
probabilities at the bottom of the visualization are upside down because they're at the bottom of the square that the board makes. However, it's still easy to read what the
visualization are because there are bars next to each probability that comparatively represent the probabilities next to each other. Something I don't like about this 
visualization is that there's no title, so a first-time reader wouldn't be able to know that the numbers represent the probability of a player landing on that spot. Something I
like about this visualization is the extra stats about the board and how they're arranged on the outside of the board so they're easier to read. I think it's really 
interesting that the least visited spot is the 'Go To Jail' spot. Meanwhile, the most visited spot is the 'Jail' spot. Overalll, this is a readable visualization due to the 
placement of the representative bars, as well as the use of color to depict the differences between properties and locations on the board.
