3/7/21 Reflection

In this reflection, I'll be reviewing [this data visualization](https://wid.world/country/usa/) that depicts the inequality of wealth in the USA. This visualization is really 
interesting to me because of how interactive it is. Users can toggle between lots of different types of data regarding inequality regarding wealth. Furthermore, the USA data is 
only a part of the global data that is included ni the rest of the website that I found this visualization on. IN addition to this, users can export the raw data as CSV files. 
This is useful because the data can be publicly taken and rearranged to create more visualizations of the same data. This can let people interpret the data differently based on 
how it's displayed. ONe thing I don't like about this visualization is the lack of explanation, in regards to how to read and understand the indicators that can be used to measure
inequality based on wealth. I think a nice addition to this visualization would be a hover tip-tool, in which whenever users hover over selecting a key indicator, a pop-up box will
appear that has a few sentences explaining what that indicator means. Even though there is an information icon button with additional info on the right side of the chart, it's not 
intuitive for users to click on that icon, as opposed to just hovering over the information that they want to learn more about. Overall, I find this visualization interesting 
because it has alot of opportunity to display the data in different ways since there's the option to toggle between different parts of the raw dataset, and the user can even 
download different parts and/or all of the raw data themselves.
