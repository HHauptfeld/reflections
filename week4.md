2/28/21 Reflection

In this reflection, I'll be reviewing [this data visualization](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/lt0748/oc_google_trends_the_rise_fall_of_the_phrase_keep/) 
that depicts the trend of how often the phrase 'keep calm and carry on" was googled from 2005-2020. I picked this visualization because I find it really interesting how that
phrase became very popular in 2012 specifically. In addition to that, there is a very clear spike at 2012, indiciating that the phrase was only popular during that time frame 
and no others. One exception is the slight spike at the very beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic. However, it still remains that 'keep calm and carry on' was most popular as a 
Google search in 2012. In regards to the style of the visualization, I like how they used Google's colors and a line chart to depict the data. I liked it because it made it 
easier to read and had an appropriate theme. However, some things that I don't like about this visualization is the large blocks of text at the bottom, and the fact that some
of that text is in a yellow font against a light gray background, making it very hard to read. Although, the text is interesting and relevant to the visulization, it could 
probably be displayed or told to the audience in a more creative way. On a final note, one thing that I liked about this visualization is the specific points of the chart that
are marked as to what was happening at the time for a certain spike to occur, such as when 'mass media imitation' was at it's highest in 2012, and clearly stating where on the
chart that the Covid-19 pandemic started.
